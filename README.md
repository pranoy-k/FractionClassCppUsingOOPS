**Description**: Defining a C++ Fraction Class. It has support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, greater than, greater than or equals, less than, less than or equals, cout. Everything is implemented using operator overloading for the benefit of ease of use for the user.

**Dependencies**: gcc compiler C++ 11
Headers Include : #include <cmath> <string> <exception> <algorithm> <vector> <unordered_map> <utility> <limits.h>

### **Compilation Command**:  g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Fraction.cpp -o Fraction

**Run Command**: ./Fraction 
> Note: To play around try using Fraction for Mac users and Fraction.exe for windows users

**Sample Output**: Pasted Below

-------------------------------------------------------------

*What fractions do you want to operate on?*

*Enter 1 number*
*Enter the Numerator:: 3*
*Enter the Denominator:: 5*
*The Fraction you entered is a : 3/5*

*Enter 2 number*
*Enter the Numerator:: 6*
*Enter the Denominator:: -9*
*The Fraction you entered is b : -2/3*

*Operation to perform include (+ - * / == != > < >= <=)*
*Select one of these :: -*

*3/5 - -2/3 = 19/15*

*Do you wish to continue (Y or N):: Y*
