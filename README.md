**Description**: Defining a C++ Fraction Class. It has support for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, greater than, greater than or equals, less than, less than or equals, cout. Everything is implemented using operator overloading for the benefit of ease of use for the user.

**Dependencies**: gcc compiler C++ 11
Headers Include : #include <cmath> <string> <exception> <algorithm> <vector> <unordered_map> <utility> <limits.h>

### **Compilation Command**:  g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Fraction.cpp -o Fraction

**Run Command**: ./Fraction 
> Note: To play around try using Fraction for Mac users and Fraction.exe for windows users

**Sample Output**: Pasted Below

-------------------------------------------------------------

What fractions do you want to operate on?

Enter First number
Enter the Number in the form a/b ::  6/8
The First Fraction is a/b : 3/4

Enter Second number
Enter the Number in the form a/b ::  -7/10
The Second Fraction is b : -7/10

Operation to perform include (+ - * / == != > < >= <=) 
Select one of these :: +

3/4 + -7/10 = 1/20

Do you wish to continue? (Y or N):: Y

Do you wish to continue operating with the Answer? (Y or N):: Y
